# Experiments
## Experiment 1: 
Check if the bitmaps for the same number of nodes but for different instances give different outputs

## Esperiment 2: 
Give the neural net some past values and see if it predicts correctly 

## Experiment 3:
relu vs sigmoid in the first layer 

# Tasks
## Task 1 

Modify the distiller class to handle different sets of training data for teacher and student

Only the n_truth has to be replaced in teacher's predictions 

## Task 2

Train student (onlive vs offline)

## Task 3a

Try regularization techniques

## Task 3b

Fitting to training data aggresively in online scenario 

## Task 4 

Documentation + cleaning up repo
